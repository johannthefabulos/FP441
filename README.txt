3. This program is supposed to be a sort of pac man. However there are only 5 nuggets to eat and instead of blinkys there is a single death sphere at the center that slowly gets bigger after the first nugget is eaten.
when the user gets 3 nuggets they evolve into a donkey rider who can jump to great lengths and is invulnerable allowing the death sphere to take no effect.
Each border is a barrier..except one, can you find it? If you get all 5 nuggets you will jump in the air and fall in the floor in victory instead of defeat. The sparkles you see
after eating the first nugget will change color as you collect more nuggets.
4.  The implementation is as follows:
    1.If you are bad at the game and actually need light to see then press 8
    2.If you want to actually play the game you will have to press 3 to be character 3 for the entire duration
    3.You must continue to hold w when you launch up when eating a nugget our you will die this is to simulate what will happen if you lose control
    4.Walls can eat you so tread carefully not to touch them, if you do there is a chance you won't be hurt.
    5.Your goal is to collect all 5 nuggets before the death ball in the middle kills you, if you become a donkey rider you are immortal
        donkey riders can jump by pressing space(remember if you can't hold w while being launched you will fall to a painful death in the oblivion)
    6.Camera instructions are as follows:
    Switching Camera Views:
        -Z (Move to Hero Mode (ArcBallCam))
        -X (Move to FreeCam Mode)
    In any mode:
        -V (Enable Top View Picture in Picture)
        -C (Enable First Person Picture in Picute)
    In Hero Mode (ArcBall Cam):
        -W (Move Forward)
        -S (Move Backward)
        -A (Turn Left)
        -D (Turn Right)
        -Left Click (Special Action & Rotate Screen)
        -Scroll Wheel OR Shift+Left Click (Zoom In/Out)
        -Numbers 1 to 3 (Choose Hero: 1 - TheWarrior, 2 - Eeyore, 3 - JohnReimann)
    In Free Cam Mode:
        -W (Pan Up)
        -S (Pan Down)
        -A (Pan Left)
        -D (Pan Right)
        -Space (Fly Forward)
        -Shift+Space (Fly backward)
Bugs:
    There is a bug where the program suddently shuts down for no reason every once in a while
    There is a bug where the wall will stick to the hero and not allow it to move every once in a while in skinny corridors.
NOTE:BOTH THE DONKEY AND WARRIOR WERE NOT CREATED BY THIS GROUP BUT BY JOHNS OLD MIDTERM GROUP MATRIX MAGIC GROUP
5.  To compile, load the CMAKELISTS, choose your target to run on, which should be generated in the cmake-build-debug
       folder and run.

6. If you click while TheWarrior is selected, he swings his sword. If you click while Eeyore is selected his eyes turn red.
8. Total time was approximately 50 Hours for everyone total (Very ballpark estimate)
9. The lab and assignment helped a lot for this project. 7/10
10. This assignment was a 8/10. Would have been better if we had more time.
