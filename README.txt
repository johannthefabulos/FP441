2. MP -- The Main Attraction
3. This program is designed to create an arena of our Heroes and a car in an environment with custom lighting.
   The arena consist of a border of castles, with trees dispersed around. Our heroes have the ability to walk around the
   inside of the castle perimeter and wonder about. This also gives the user to switch between heroes. Some heroes preform
   sepecial actions as well. The viewpoints of the heroes are an arcball camera. You are then able to enable a picture-in-
   picture view for either the top down view or the first person view. There is also the ability to use the Freecam to move
   around in the space.
4.  The implementation is as follows:
    In any mode:
        -V (Enable Top View Picture in Picture)
        -C (Enable First Person Picture in Picute)
    In Hero Mode (ArcBall Cam):
        -W (Move Forward)
        -S (Move Backward)
        -A (Turn Left)
        -D (Turn Right)
        -Left Click (Special Action & Rotate Screen)
        -Scroll Wheel OR Shift+Left Click (Zoom In/Out)
        -Numbers 1 to 4 (Choose Hero: 1 - TheWarrior, 2 - Eeyore, 3 - JohnReimann, 4 - Car)
    In Free Cam Mode:
        -W (Pan Up)
        -S (Pan Down)
        -A (Pan Left)
        -D (Pan Right)
        -Space (Fly Forward)
        -Shift+Space (Fly backward)


5.  To compile, load the CMAKELISTS, choose your target to run on, which should be generated in the cmake-build-debug
       folder and run.

6. If you click while TheWarrior is selected, he swings his sword. If you click while Eeyore is selected he eyes turn red.
7. The breakdown is as follows:
    -Each student was responsible for their own hero.
    -Environment - Connor
    -Camera & Viewports - Ben
    -Shader & VAO - Everybody
    - Illumination - Everybody

8. Total time was approximately 50 Hours for everyone total (Very ballpark estimate)
9. The lab and assignment helped a lot for this project. 7/10
10. This assignment was a 8/10. Would have been better if we had more time.
